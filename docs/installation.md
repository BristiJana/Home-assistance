- An entity will have the value 'Unavailable' until the charger successfully connects.
- An entity will have the value 'Unknown' until its value has been read from the charger.

## Configure your Charger

- Configure your charger to use the OCPP websocket of your Central System (e.g. ws://homeassistant.local:9000). This is charger specific, so consult your manual.
- Some chargers require the protocol section 'ws://' to be removed, or require the url to end with a '/'.
- Some chargers require the url to be specified as an IP address, i.e. '192.168.178.1:9000'
- You may need to reboot your charger before the changes become effective.
